# PROJECT MIXED MESSAGES

## GOALS:
- Use JS (ES6), Node.js and Git to create a random message generator app.
- The theme for the messages to be generated can be freely chosen by the authors.
- The user may be capable of running the app any ammount of times he or she wants to.
- Each and every time the an user runs the program, it generates a new random message.

## STEPS:
1. Chosse a theme (inspirational messages).
2. Create a script file and check if Node is working properly
3. Set-up version control
4. Store message components to be used on the program
5. Add functionality to randomly select the messages components to create a random message
6. Combine the different parts of the program so the random messages are selected, combined and then displayed to the user each time they run the program.
